            Mexico.
            <em>(I wonder who?)</em></li>

          <li>(L11) We first meet Wang Xue, who, at the inquiry of the janitor, we find out is heading to the post office. He wants to send a package to Australia. Between ¥7600, 7 days air shipping and ¥3450, 2 months sea shipping, he opts for the sea option.
            Guess it isn't urgent.</li>
          <li>(L12) Miller returns back from Kyoto, having been at Gion Matsuri, Kyoto's most famous festival. He gives the janitor a souvenir from Kyoto, and shows him photos of Kyoto. Miller is quite tired from the trip.</li>

          <li>(L14) We first meet Karina (her name's just Karina), who is heading to Midoricho (Green Street, I guess?). Taking the taxi, she tells the taxi to turn right at the intersection, and go straight, and soon after stop by a flower shop. Paying ¥5000

          <li>(L17) Our first introduction to
            <popover effect="scale" placement="top" trigger="hover"><template slot="content">BUCHOU!</template>Matsumoto</popover>, who's visting the door. He has sore throat and slight fever. He's wants to get well as soon as possible because he must go to a work trip to Kyoto the next day. Originally, he
            was supposed to rest for 2, 3 days. But the doctor said he could take medicine, and rest early for the night. And no hot baths.</li>
          <li>(L18) Yamada learns about Santos's animal photography hobby, especially on horses. Ever since coming to Japan, Santos haven't taken much horse photos saying there isn't many horses to see. Yamada recommends him to visit Hokkaido as there are
            many horses. After learning this, Santos hopes to visit there during summer break.</li>
          <li>(Novel 1 Chapter 15) We learn more about the Hokkaido trip.</li>
          <li>(L19) At a party, we have our first appareance of Matsumoto-buchou's wife, Matsumoto Yoshiko. Yoshiko asks Maria why she isn't eating alot. We then learn that Maria is on a diet, and Yoshiko has diet before as well. Yoshiko's diet consisted
            of only eating apples and drinking alot of water. But too much of dieting is bad, Yoshiko says. Maria agrees, but after hearing Yoshiko say the ice cream is good, she decides to forget about dieting. She'll start tomorrow (or so she says).</li>
          <li>(L20) Kobayashi (who is never introduced in the Characters section) asks Thawaphon if he's heading back to Thailand for summer break. After learning that Thawaphon can't, even though he wants to, asks him if climbed a mountain before. They make
            initial plans to go a climbing trip at the beginning of August.</li>
          <li>(L21) Matsumoto sees Santos outside, it's been a long time since they saw each other, and invites him for day drinks. There will be a soccer match at 10pm between Japan and Brazil. Santos thinks Brazil will surely win but Matsumoto thinks Japan
            is getting stronger lately. Santos seems uncomfortable and makes an excuse to leave. Matusmoto takes the hint.</li>
          <li>(L22) Wang is buying a new house. What seems to be a good candidate for Wang is a place 10 minutes from the station and ¥83000 rent. Seems to be a traditional home with a 和室 and a 押入れ.</li>
          <li>(L23) Karina is now going to Midori Library (which I bet is at Midoricho), a white building located inside park, which is 3 stops from Honda Station when taking 3 stops. She asks for directions.</li>
          <li>(L24) Wang is moving (I guess he got his new place!) on a Sunday morning. Miller, Yamada and Karina is helping him during his move. Yamada is offering his car, and Karina is bringing some lunch bentos.</li>
          <li>(L25) Miller is relocated to IMC Tokyo. Everyone is there, Satou, Kimura, Yamada, Matusmoto (and his wife), etc. Kimura teases that Miller will get lonely in Tokyo, and tells Miller not to forget his time in Kyoto. Miller asks them to visit
            Tokyo when they're free, and Santos tells him to call him up for drinks whenever he drops by Kyoto. Satou tells Miller to do his best and take care. Miller wishes the best for everyone.</li>
