## Kyoto Arc

* (L1) Mike Miller's first day in IMC (Kyoto). Yamada Ichiro introduces him to Satou Keiko, and Miller puts his hand out for a handshake instead of bowing. 
* (Novel 1 Chapter 1) We learn more details about Miller's first day.
* (L2) Hose Santos, a Brazil Air employee, goes to the door to Yamada's apartment, introduces himself, and gives Yamada some coffee as a gift.
* (L3) Maria Santos (Hose's wife, a housewife) goes to the wine section at the basement of the department store. Goes to buy a <popover effect="scale" content="SGD31.63" placement="top" trigger="hover">¥2500</popover> Japanese bottle.

* (L6) Satou asks Miller out to go for a Hanami party with her friend. It's at Osaka castle and they settle to meet at Osaka station at 10 o'clock.
* (Novel 1 Chapter 5) Turns out that friend is Kimura Izumi, announcer.
* (L7) Hose and Maria Santos visit Yamada Ichiro and his wife, Yamada Tomoko's (a bank clerk) house. Tomoko offers coffee (most likely the Brazilian coffee Hose gave in L2) and Maria comments on Tomoko's cool looking spoon. Turns out it's a colleague's souvenir from Mexico. *(I wonder who?)*
* (L8) For what seems like a continuation of L7, Ichiro asks Hose and Maria about life. Maria finds life in Japan enjoyable, while Hose says work is busy but interesting. Tomoko asks if they'd like more coffee, but they declined, saying that had enough. Hose announces it's time to leave when it hits 6pm.

* (L10) Miller is trying to find Asia Store, which located at a white building. In the store he wants to buy <popover effect="scale" content="[A Thai Dipping Sauce](https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/nam-pla-prik-recipe)" placement="top" trigger="hover">nampla</popover>, located at the most bottom level of one of the shelves at the Thai Cuisine Section.
* (L11) We first meet Wang Xue, doctor at Kobe Hospital, who, at the inquiry of the janitor, we find out is heading to the post office. He wants to send a package to Australia. Between ¥7600, 7 days shipping by airr and ¥3450, 2 months by sea, he opts for the sea option. Guess it isn't urgent.
* (L12) Miller returns back from Kyoto, having been at Gion Matsuri, Kyoto's most famous festival. He gives the janitor a souvenir from Kyoto, and shows him photos from there. Miller is quite tired from the trip.
* (L13) Miller and Yamada have lunch at noon at Tsuruya. Miller orders a Tempura set (¥980), while Yamada orders the cheaper Beef Don (¥700).
* (Novel 1 Chapter 10) We have a more detailed version of Miller and Yamada's lunch. We learn more about Yamada in this chapter.
* (L14) We first meet Karina (her name's just Karina), a student at Fuji University, who is heading to Midoricho (Green Street, I guess?). Taking the taxi, she tells the driver to turn right at the intersection, and go straight, and soon after stop by a flower shop. Paying ¥5000 for the ¥1800 taxi ride, she receives ¥3200 change.
* (Novel 1 Chapter 11) After a party of drinks, Miller settles a date with Kimura to watch a movie.
* (L15) After what was apparently a good movie, Miller and Kimura are at a cafe. Miller is reminded of his family and they go on talking about their families. Miller has a family for 4 with an older sister. His parents live near New York and his sister works at London. Meanwhile, Kimura is an only child, her father works at the bank and her mother teaches English at high school.

* (L17) Our first introduction to <popover effect="scale" content="BUCHOU!" placement="top" trigger="hover">Matsumoto</popover>, chief of the department Miller, Yamada and Keiko is in, who's visting the doctor. He has a sore throat and slight fever. He's wants to get well as soon as possible because he must go on a work trip to Kyoto the next day. Originally, the doctor suggested he rest for 2, 3 days. But the he then said Matsumoto could take medicine, and rest early for the night. And also one more thing, no hot baths.
* (L18) Yamada learns about Santos's animal photography hobby, especially on horses. Ever since coming to Japan, Santos hasn't taken much horse photos, saying there isn't many horses to see in the country. Yamada recommends him to visit Hokkaido as there are many horses. After learning this, Santos hopes to visit there during summer break.
* (Novel 1 Chapter 15) We learn more about the Hokkaido trip.
* (L19) At a party, we have our first appareance of Matsumoto-buchou's wife, Matsumoto Yoshiko, a housewife. Yoshiko asks Maria why she isn't eating alot. We then learn that Maria is on a diet, and Yoshiko has gone on a diet before as well. Yoshiko's diet consisted of only eating apples and drinking alot of water. But too much of dieting is bad, Yoshiko says. Maria agrees, but after hearing Yoshiko's comment that the ice cream is good, she decides to forget about dieting. She'll start tomorrow (or so she says).
* (L20) Kobayashi (who is never introduced in the Characters section) asks Thawaphon, a student at a Japanese language school, if he's heading back to Thailand during summer break. After learning that Thawaphon can't even though he wants to, asks him if climbed a mountain before. They make initial plans to go a climbing trip at the beginning of August.
* (L21) Matsumoto sees Santos outside, it's been a long time since they saw each other. He invites him for day drinks. There will be a soccer match at 10pm between Japan and Brazil. Santos thinks Brazil will surely win but Matsumoto thinks Japan is getting stronger lately. Santos seems uncomfortable and makes an excuse to leave. Matusmoto takes the hint.
* (L22) Wang is buying a new house. What seems to be a good candidate for Wang is a place 10 minutes from the station and have ¥83000 rent. Seems to be a traditional Japanese home with a 和室 and an 押入れ.
* (L23) Karina is now going to Midori Library (which I bet is at Midoricho), a white building located inside park, which is 3 stops from Honda Station when taking 3 stops. She asks for directions.
* (L24) Wang is moving (I guess he got his new place!) on a Sunday morning. Miller, Yamada and Karina is helping him during his move. Yamada is offering his car, and Karina is bringing some lunch bentos.
* (L25) Miller is relocated to IMC Tokyo, so they're having a farewell party. Everyone is there, Satou, Kimura, Yamada, Matusmoto (and his wife), etc, you know it. Kimura teases that Miller will get lonely in Tokyo, and tells Miller not to forget his time in Kyoto. Miller asks them to visit Tokyo when they're free, and Santos tells him to call him up for drinks whenever he drops by Kyoto. Satou tells Miller to do his best and take care. Miller wishes the best for everyone.
