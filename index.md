# Hi I'm Brian 
And I'm in my last year in National University of Singapore with a degree in Computer Science. I have a general interest to create, be it as a Software Engineer contributing to products, or making a [simple tool](https://github.com/nbriannl/Oboeru/) simply because I feel compelled to make my life easier. I also produce [music](https://soundcloud.com/br1ne) as a hobby. I am more inclined to, and more familar with, working on front end. I find it very satisfying to contribute changes most visble to users and impactful to their experience.

I interned in HOOQ for 2 separate summer internships. HOOQ is a video on demand streaming service with markets in Southeast Asia and India.

For my first internship, I worked on HOOQ's progressive web application (m.hooq.tv). Some of frameworks used to build it are React, Redux, Koa and Webpack.

In my second time at HOOQ, I worked on the TV Application for LG and Samsung TVs, built with BBC's TV Application Layer, a Javascript Library. With the library, one can build reusable UI compnents. And with a single codebase, one can release for multiple television platforms.

In both internships I worked in a Scrum Team of 5-8 people, including developers and product owner. I have grown familiar to working in an Agile workflow, having contributed to tickets in 2-week long sprints.

I'm interested in Front End Engineering roles, or general Application Development roles. While the former may be a more familiar path, I would take any experience to build applications as a chance to develop myself.


# About this MarkBind Subsite

[MarkBind](https://markbind.org/) is an open source project I am contributing to in my last semester as part of the module [CS3281/2](https://nus-cs3281.github.io/website/admin/callForApplications.html).

MarkBind can generate <popover effect="scale" content="[This link to the docs about popover's was written in Markdown!](https://markbind.org/userGuide/usingComponents.html#trigger)" placement="top" trigger="hover">dynamic</popover> websites from Markdown text. In particular, **text-heavy** websites like the [NUS's Software Engineering Module](https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/website/) site.
