>What have I done?

If I were to look back at my 4 years, this is my story, or least, the highlights I remember. They're mainly for me to reflect on.

# 2016/17

## Semester 1 

* I learnt how to program in C for my introductory Programming Methodology module.
* I cried over one Programming Methodology take home lab exercise at Week 3 or 4. Mainly because I had a coders block, and worried I might never understand how to think programmatically. Turns out, I'd be fine.

## Winter Break

* First encounter with Javascript, albeit pre-ES6. 
* Participated in GameCraft, a 24 hour hackathon. With me and my friend, we modelled planetary gravity for the game, when we could have probably used a library. The games were really basic pre-ES6 javascript games. You can find them [here](https://github.com/nbriannl/gamecraftgame) and [here](https://github.com/nbriannl/gamecraftgame2)

## Semester 2

* The programming mods this sem and the next had me code in Java.
* Took Japanese Level 1, at the cost of my CAP (I think). Would resume taking Japanese 3 semesters later.
* Took linear algebra, not really caring much for it, not knowing how relevant it would be in my AI focus area later on.

## Summer Break

* Exposed to Javascript, EJS, Express and MongoDB.
* Did an NUS Orbital project with a friend. We wanted to make a virtual noticeboard for all school events. [Here](https://github.com/zacharytang/NUSEvents) is the repo. I learnt React (i.e. did the Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial) and then gave up trying to learn how to set up a MERN stack. In the end, I made the frontend with EJS templating, styled with Bootstrap.

# 2017/18

## Semester 1

* Became Publicity Manager of the NUS Electronic Music Lab.
* Did my Software Engineer module, which involved an Address Book application written in Java and JavaFX.

## Winter Break

* Nothing I can remember.

## Semester 2

* Learn PostgresSQL in my Database mod, and dabbled with PHP for a [project](https://github.com/CS2102-Team31/Snatch) :cold_sweat:
* Introduction to AI had me do a project to train a Tetris playing agent. [Repo here](https://github.com/szenius/tetris-agent). Me and my friend/senior utilised Particle Swarm Optimization while the other 2 trained with a Genetic Algorithm.

## Summer Break

* Interned at HOOQ. Worked on their mobile web app (now it's both desktop and mobile web). Wrote with Javascript, mainly worked with React and Redux.

# 2018/19

## Semester 1

* Served a 2nd term of Publicity Manager.
* Took Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. We had me learning and using mostly Python.

## Winter Break

* Nothing I can remember

## Semester 2

* Took Big Data Systems for Data Science, which exposed me to the language Scala, and the frameworks/libraries Hadoop and Spark. The big data project me and my friend did involved the MyAnimeList data set. I used Spark to make a recommender system, and did some time series visualizations on the data. No repo hosts this project :pensive:
* I resumed taking Japanese from this sem onwards, taking it at Level 2.

## Summer Break

* I interned at HOOQ once more. Now working on the Smart TV application that was built using the TAL library developed by BCC.

# 2019/20

## Semester 1

* Worked part time Teaching Assistant to two modules: Computer Networking, and Software Engineering.
* Took Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. Most of the assignments were in Python, utilising many CV and ML libraries, especially openCV and sklearn.

## Winter Break

* Nothing I can remember
* I rushed out a [CLI program written in Python](https://github.com/nbriannl/Oboeru/) to help me practice for my weekly Japanese vocabulary quizzes. One day, I want to make it a React App. Or maybe Vue.
* Applied for jobs around mid to end Decemeber.

## Semester 2

* Still finding a job
* Working part time Teaching Assistant to Computer Networking.
* Taking Japanese Level 4.
* Contributing to [MarkBind](https://markbind.org/) as part of CS module: CS3281/2
